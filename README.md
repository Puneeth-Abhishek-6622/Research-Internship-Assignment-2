# Research-Internship-Assignment-2
Train a neural language model from scratch using PyTorch. The goal is to demonstrate  understanding of how sequence models learn to predict text and how model design and  training affect performance. 


- Perplexity :in the context of language modeling, is a measure that quantifies how well a language model predicts a given test set, with lower perplexity indicating better predictive performance. In simpler terms, perplexity is calculated by taking the inverse probability of the test set and then normalizing it by the number of words. The lower the perplexity value, the better the language model is at predicting the test set. Minimizing perplexity is the same as maximizing probability
## Interpreting perplexity as a branching factor
- Perplexity can be interpreted as a measure of the branching factor in a language model. The branching factor represents the average number of possible next words or tokens given a particular context or sequence of words.
The Branching factor of a language is the number of possible next words that can follow any word. We can think of perplexity as the weighted average branching factor of a language.


## choosing the right setup to build the model 

- The Language Modeling with Embedding Layer and LSTM code is a powerful tool for building and training language models
- The embedding layer is responsible for converting text data into distributed representations, also known as word embeddings. These embeddings capture semantic and syntactic properties of words, allowing the model to understand the meaning and context of the input text. The embedding layer maps each word in the input sequence to a high-dimensional vector, which serves as the input for subsequent layers in the model.
- The LSTM layer in the code implementation processes the word embeddings generated by the embedding layer, capturing the sequence information and learning the underlying patterns and structures in the text.
- By combining the embedding layer and LSTM network, the code enables the construction of a language model that can generate coherent and contextually appropriate text. Language models built using this approach can be trained on large textual datasets and are capable of generating realistic and meaningful sentences, making them valuable tools for various natural language processing tasks such as text generation, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.
- Through this code, you can gain a deeper understanding of how embedding layers and LSTMs work together to capture the complex patterns and dependencies within text data. With this knowledge, you can further extend the code and explore advanced techniques, such as incorporating attention mechanisms or transformer architectures, to enhance the performance and capabilities of your language models.
